Custom Biomes can be created to spawn specific Mobs or generate special Strucutres. 
You can also edit which Particles are spawned, which Sounds are used and what Colors are used.

##### Important: You need to rejoin after registration to the server **OR** register the Custom Biome on Server-Start.
##### Otherwhise Particles, Sounds and Colors may not work!

First you need to create an CustomBiome Object:
``` CustomBiome custombiome = new CustomBiome(BiomeName) ```
The BiomeName is also displayed ingame when you press F3
